Basic Commands
--------------

* To run the project open a terminal and run::
    **$ export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml**

* Then build the images::
    **$ docker-compose build**

* Then run the app with::
    **$ docker-compose up**

For developer purpouses open a new terminal and kill the django container::
    **$ docker rm -f django**

Finally, up the django container in the current terminal::
    **$ docker-compose run --rm --service-ports django**

Now you can open the browser and go to **localhost:8000/**

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
